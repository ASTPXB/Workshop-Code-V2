US Might

Point- US economic strength 

Being the world’s largest producer, the USA had a strong industrial foundation and was able to quickly switch from production of consumer goods to production of military equipment.

After Great Depression, the USA had many unemployed people who were eager to work.

These willing citizens proved to be far better that the workers who were forced into labour in the fascist states.

Japan did not have such a strong industrial foundation or capabilities to support their war effort.

Thus the USA’s rich economy and strong industrial capability boosted the Allies’ war machinery and enabled the Allies to sustain their war effort against Japan.

This gave the Allies a strong advantage over Japan, whose limited resources were further crippled when the USA intensified its attacks on Japan and its merchant ships.

6,20/11/2023 20:07:09,1,1,"The war that involved Japan, known as the Pacific War, was part of the larger conflict of World War II. The war in the Pacific is generally considered to have started on December 7, 1941, when Japan launched a surprise attack on the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. This attack led the United States to formally enter World War II.

The reasons behind Japan's entry into the war are complex and include a desire for expansion and control over Asia and the Pacific, the need for natural resources, and the ambition to become a dominant world power. Japan had already been engaged in aggressive military campaigns in China since the 1930s, and its expansionist policies put it at odds with the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries.

The attack on Pearl Harbor was intended to neutralize the U.S. Pacific Fleet, allowing Japan to advance its goals in Southeast Asia and the Pacific without immediate American interference. However, the attack galvanized the United States and brought it fully into the war, joining the Allies against the Axis powers, which included Germany, Italy, and Japan.",How the war started in Japan,Lesson Collaborator (Chatbot),1500.2,2
